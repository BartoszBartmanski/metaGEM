### Toy dataset tutorial

Although compiled while metaGEM was still in development, [this slightly outdated tutorial](https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM/blob/master/Tutorial/tutorial.md) can provide additional insight as to how metaGEM is implemented and used. The [toy dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3534949#.XclQriV7lTZ) was generated by subsetting real shotgun [sequencing samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=ERP002469) from the human gut using the [seqtk tool](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk):

```
seqtk sample -s100 sample_X.fastq.gz 3000000 > subset_X.fastq.gz
```

The idea was to design a small and portable dataset amenable to unit testing, however the size reduction came at the expense of performance. In retrospect, it may have been a better idea to [generate a synthetic/artificial metagenomic dataset](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM) from a handful of genomes.
